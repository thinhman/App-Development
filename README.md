My Android Studio Projects.
Some of them are demos to learn techniques.

The main projects are the Instagram and Uber clone. (Whole project were to big to upload so its just the source code)
The skills learned are mostly used in these two projects.

Instagram Clone: 
  -Use putty ssh client to connect to AWS parse server to store accounts/pictures.
  -Login menu
  -connects to other users

Uber Clone:
  -Used Google Maps Api to display nearby pick up locations and directions to location
  -Also diplays updated location of Uber Driver
  -Used putty ssh client to connect to AWS parse sever to store locations and account info.
  -Login menu and switches from customer UI to Uber Driver UI
